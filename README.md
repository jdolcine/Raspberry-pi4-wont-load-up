# Raspberry-pi4-wont-load-up
I am building a drone and have downloaded NAVIO2 image (Emlid Raspbian software). after burning it to an SD CARD, and try to upload it, I receive an error message stating "the board requires newer software. 
I cant understand how the emlid image is not new enough or what am I missing?
based on my error message; is says recover4.elf not found, recovery.elf not found, start4x.elf not compatible. 

any help would be greatly appreciated. 

Thanks
